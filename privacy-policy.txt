"DIY Remote" app is provided by nocomake YouTube project. 

It does not collect any personal data, nor it sends any user data
over Internet. 
App has no server side, the only network traffic is the TCP stream 
of binary commands sent to the IP address and port user explicitly 
specifies in the app settings.

App also allows Bluetooth connection that technically allows to 
collect Bluetooth devices identification information for devices
in range that technically may be used to locate user, but the app
does not send visible beacons anywhere, nor it stores them internally,
Bluetooth stack is only used to chose the paired device and open serial 
connection to it to send the binary control stream which is the main 
and only purpose of the app.
